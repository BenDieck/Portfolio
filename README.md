This is a file that exists to hold my portfolio artifacts for my Master in Applied Data Science for Syracuse, class of 2024. 
If any of this information is useful to you please cite and enjoy. 

I have likely included poor citation, and incorrect citation within my artifacts that I haven't addressed as my final turn ins are not completely included on this site. 
I'm still learning how to use this site. 

Message me and I'll try to help. :)

Final_Proj_2023-3-24 is an analysis of the IBM attrition dataset. The original dataset should be available online and the retrievable is in the code. 
It was compiled by three authors, myself, Mr. Justin Richardson, and Mr. Erik Newcome

Fun project that included a lot of really great visualizations because we had a proffessor that taught the visualization course. So we made our final picture heavy. 
It worked.
