This is a file that exists to hold my portfolio artifacts for my Master in Applied Data Science for Syracuse, class of 2024. 
If any of this information is useful to you please cite and enjoy. 

I have likely included poor citation, and incorrect citation within my artifacts that I haven't addressed as my final turn ins are not completely included on this site. 
I'm still learning how to use this site. 

Message me and I'll try to help. :)

The two papers that are located in this file are papers I wrote for my Information Policy course. It was a course I took deliberately to examine ethical issues facing society
given the introduction of an invasive technology like Chat GPT and other LLMs. As Machine Learning grows more complex, the issues surrounding knowledge inequality
, open source information, and the ethical use of technology / data will likewise become more complicated. It is why it is essential to consider matters of ethics
in the initial stages of technology development, and not as an afterthought.
