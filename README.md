15APR2024 - This SQL file was built on a ton of internet research from disparate sources. The sum of the research is desrcibed in the write up, but the code (SQL) creates a relational database we effectionately started calling the anarchy library,
or "Operation Intellectual Freedom" that served to start asking some of the questions we wanted answering about banned books. 
Some of the questions were things like, are they being banned for the reasons they are being said they are being banned for? 
Or if you give me a topic matter on its own can I predict a place where it is likely to be banned just because you are talking about it. 

Few topics are so dangerous that they do not merit being spoken of.
